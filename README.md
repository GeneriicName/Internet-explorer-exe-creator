# Internet-explorer-exe-creator
This is a simple python script i wrote with a minimalistic GUI, in order to create executable (.exe) files which will launch internet explorer, as it was disabled in 2023 and is still needed in many companies.
The script lets you choose a URL, icon and an output path (there's also a button to extract an icon from existing executable), and then creates a Visual Basic script compiled into an executable, which works even in newer windows builds in which internet explorer is disabled.

## Installation

```batch
git clone https://github.com/GeneriicName/Internet-explorer-exe-creator
cd Internet-explorer-exe-creator
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## You can use it as you wish, if you have feedback, feel free.
